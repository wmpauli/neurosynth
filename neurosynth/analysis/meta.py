        features: A list of named features to generate meta-analysis maps for.
        image_type: The type of image to return. Specify one of the extensions
            generated by the MetaAnalysis procedure--e.g., pFgA_z, pAgF, etc. By
            default, will use pFgA_z (i.e., z-scores reflecting the probability
            that a Mappable has a feature given that activation is present).
        threshold: The threshold for determining whether or not a Mappable has
            a feature. By default, this is 0.001, which is only sensible in the
            case of term-based features (so be sure to specify it for other kinds).
        q: The FDR rate to use for multiple comparisons correction (default = 0.05).
        save: Directory to save all meta-analysis images to. Images will be 
            created in this directory and prepended with the feature name.
            If none, returns all the data as a matrix.

    be bisected into studies that are and are not included in the

            ids: A list of Mappable IDs to include in the meta-analysis.
            ids2: Optional second list of Mappable IDs. If passed, the set of studies will
                be restricted to the union of ids and ids2 before performing the meta-analysis.
                This is useful for meta-analytic contrasts, as the resulting images will in
                effect identify regions that are reported/activated more frequently in one
                list than in the other.
            q: The FDR threshold to use when correcting for multiple comparisons. Set to
                .01 by default.
            prior: The prior to use when calculating conditional probabilities. This is the
                prior probability of a feature being used in a study (i.e., p(F)). For example,
                if set to 0.25, the analysis will assume that 1/4 of studies load on the target
                feature, as opposed to the empirically estimated p(F), which is len(ids) /
                total number of studies in the dataset. If prior is not passed, defaults to 0.5,
                reflecting an effort to put all terms on level footing and avoid undue influence
                of base rates (because some terms are much more common than others). Note that
                modifying the prior will only affect the effect size/probability maps, and
                not the statistical inference (z-score) maps.
            min_studies: Integer or float indicating which voxels to mask out from results
                due to lack of stability. If an integer is passed, all voxels that activate
                in fewer than this number of studies will be ignored (i.e., a value of 0
                will be assigned in all output images). If a float in the range of 0 - 1 is
                passed, this will be interpreted as a proportion to use as the cut-off (e.g.,
                passing 0.03 will exclude all voxels active in fewer than 3% of the entire
                dataset). Defaults to 1, meaning all voxels that activate at least one study
                will be kept.
